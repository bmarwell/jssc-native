== Description

JSSC Native Libraries Automatic Build Repository

== Naming convention

The path names inside the `.jar` files are aligned to the https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin/[os-maven-plugin].
It follows the same conventions as the https://github.com/google/osdetector-gradle-plugin[osdetector-gradle-plugin].

  osname-arch-bitness[-qualifier]

* *OS names* are taken from `System.getProperty("os.name").getLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH)`.
* The **arch**itecture is normalized from `System.getProperty("os.name")`.
* The *bitness* is added as an identifying measure, as bitness may not be the same as the operating system's bitness.
  Example: You are running a 32bit jvm on a 64bit system. In this case, this should be `32`.
* An *optional qualifier* can be added for add-on chips, like *_hf* for ARM.


== Build Matrix

Linux builds will build more than just its native architecture. None of these maven modules will deploy the jssc-header.
